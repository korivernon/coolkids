  Cool Kids Fund Inc. is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization providing support to kids and seniors in need. Our primary goal is to advance learning beyond grade level for the students we support and create a brighter future for the next generation. Our secondary goal is to provide support to seniors affected by Alzheimerâ€™s Disease. Our board volunteers their time so 100% of all tax-deductible donations collected go directly to those in need. Visit the IRS to view our non-profit status.

org_team_member_1: Dr. Marlon Fuller 
org_team_member_1_description: As a child growing up in a lower socioeconomic area with low-rated schools, Dr. Fuller went on to be the first in his family to go to college receiving his doctorate in 2004 from the University of Connecticut School of Pharmacy. He and his wife Christina formed CoolKids.org as an outlet to help kids with reading and math who come from a similar background and have both an educational and financial need. When not practicing as a Pharmacist, he enjoys spending time with his family and dedicating his life to impacting elementary education to help change the future.
